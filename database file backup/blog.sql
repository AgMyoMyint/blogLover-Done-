(7, 8, 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck', '            In my life, I have given a fuck about many people and many things. I have also not given a fuck about many people and many things. And those fucks I have not given have made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPeople often say the key to confidence and success in life is to simply â€œnot give a fuck.â€ Indeed, we often refer to the strongest, most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucks given. Like â€œOh, look at Susie working weekends again, she doesnâ€™t give a fuck.â€ Or â€œDid you hear that Tom called the company president an asshole and still got a raise anyway? Holy shit, that dude does not give a fuck.â€ Or â€œJason got up and ended his date with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wasnâ€™t going to listen to her bullshit anymore. Man, that guy does not give a fuck.â€\r\n\r\nChances are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another, did not give a fuck and went on to accomplish amazing feats. Perhaps there was a time in your life where you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary heights. I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice online ranks pretty high up there in my own â€œdidnâ€™t give a fuckâ€ hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fucks given? None. Just went and did it.\r\n\r\nEverybody just wants to be liked and accepted. Except for Tim. Tim doesn\'t give a fuck.\r\n\r\nNow, while not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, itâ€™s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I donâ€™t even know what that sentence means, but I donâ€™t give a fuck. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so letâ€™s just go with it.\r\n\r\nThe point is, most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given. We give a fuck about the rude gas station attendant who gave us too many nickels. We give a fuck when a show we liked was canceled on TV. We give a fuck when our coworkers donâ€™t bother asking us about our awesome weekend. We give a fuck when itâ€™s raining and we were supposed to go jogging in the morning.\r\n\r\nFucks given everywhere. Strewn about like seeds in mother-fucking spring time. And for what purpose? For what reason? Convenience? Easy comforts? A pat on the fucking back maybe?\r\n\r\nThis is the problem, my friend.\r\n\r\nBecause when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, thatâ€™s when life fucks us.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the ability to reserve our fucks for only the most fuckworthy of situations would surely make life a hell of a lot easier. Failure would be less terrifying. Rejection less painful. Unpleasant necessities more pleasant and the unsavory shit sandwiches a little bit more savory. I mean, if we could only give a few less fucks, or a few more consciously-directed fucks, then life would feel pretty fucking easy.\r\n\r\nWhat we donâ€™t realize is that there is a fine art of non-fuck-giving. People arenâ€™t just born not giving a fuck. In fact, weâ€™re born giving way too many fucks. Ever watch a kid cry his eyes out because his hat is the wrong shade of blue? Exactly. Fuck that kid.\r\n\r\nDeveloping the ability to control and manage the fucks you give is the essence of strength and integrity. We must craft and hone our lack of fuckery over the course of years and decades. Like a fine wine, our fucks must age into a fine vintage, only uncorked and given on the most special fucking occasions.\r\n\r\nThis may sound easy. But it is not. Most of us, most of the time, get sucked in by lifeâ€™s mean trivialities, steamrolled by its unimportant dramas; we live and die by the sidenotes and distractions and vicissitudes that suck the fucks out of us like Sasha Grey in the middle of a gangbang.\r\n\r\nThis is no way to live, man. So stop fucking around. Get your fucks together. And here, allow me to fucking show you.\r\nSubtlety #1: Not Giving A Fuck Does Not Mean Being Indifferent; It Means Being Comfortable With Being Different\r\n\r\nWhen most people envision giving no fucks whatsoever, they envision a kind of perfect and serene indifference to everything, a calm that weathers all storms.\r\n\r\nThis is misguided. Thereâ€™s absolutely nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared. Theyâ€™re couch potatoes and internet trolls. In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they actually give too many fucks. They are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices. Therefore, they make none. They hide in a grey emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitied, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life.\r\n\r\nMy mother was recently screwed out of a large chunk of money by a close friend of hers. Had I been indifferent, I would have shrugged my shoulders, sipped some mocha and downloaded another season of The Wire. Sorry mom.\r\n\r\nBut instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, â€œNo, screw that, mom. Weâ€™re going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole. Why? Because I donâ€™t give a fuck. I will ruin this guyâ€™s life if I have to.â€\r\n\r\nThis illustrates the first subtlety about not giving a fuck. When we say, â€œDamn, watch out, Mark Manson just donâ€™t give a fuck,â€ we donâ€™t mean that Mark Manson doesnâ€™t care about anything; on the contrary, what we mean is that Mark Manson doesnâ€™t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesnâ€™t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble. What we mean is that Mark Manson is the type of guy who would write about himself in third person and use the word â€˜fuckâ€™ in an article 127 different times just because he thought it was the right thing to do. He just doesnâ€™t give a fuck.\r\n\r\nThis is what is so admirable â€” no, not me, dumbass â€” the overcoming adversity stuff. The staring failure in the face and shoving your middle finger back at it. The people who donâ€™t give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. The people who just laugh and then do it anyway. Because they know itâ€™s right. They know itâ€™s more important than them and their own feelings and their own pride and their own needs. They say â€œFuck it,â€ not to everything in life, but rather they say â€œFuck itâ€ to everything unimportant in life. They reserve their fucks for what truly fucking matters. Friends. Family. Purpose. Burritos. And an occasional lawsuit or two. And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things, the important things, people give a fuck about them in return.\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa Quote: I don\'t give a fuck if they remember me at all.\r\nSubtlety #2: To Not Give A Fuck About Adversity, You Must First Give A Fuck About Something More Important Than Adversity\r\n\r\nEric Hoffer once wrote: â€œA man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other peopleâ€™s business.â€\r\n\r\nThe problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they donâ€™t have anything more fuckworthy to dedicate their fucks to.\r\n\r\nThink for a second. Youâ€™re at a grocery store. And thereâ€™s an elderly lady screaming at the cashier, berating him for not accepting her 30-cent coupon. Why does this lady give a fuck? Itâ€™s just 30 cents.\r\n\r\nWell, Iâ€™ll tell you why. That old lady probably doesnâ€™t have anything better to do with her days than to sit at home cutting out coupons all morning. Sheâ€™s old and lonely. Her kids are dickheads and never visit. She hasnâ€™t had sex in over 30 years. Her pension is on its last legs and sheâ€™s probably going to die in a diaper thinking sheâ€™s in Candyland. She canâ€™t fart without extreme lower back pain. She canâ€™t even watch TV for more than 15 minutes without falling asleep or forgetting the main plotline.\r\n\r\nSo she snips coupons. Thatâ€™s all sheâ€™s got. Itâ€™s her and her damn coupons. All day, every day. Itâ€™s all she can give a fuck about because there is nothing else to give a fuck about. And so when that pimply-faced 17-year-old cashier refuses to accept one of them, when he defends his cash registerâ€™s purity the way knights used to defend maidensâ€™ virginities, you can damn well bet granny is going to erupt and verbally hulk smash his fucking face in. Eighty years of fucks will rain down all at once, like a fiery hailstorm of â€œBack in my dayâ€ and â€œPeople used to show more respectâ€ stories, boring the world around her to tears in her creaking and wobbly voice.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you â€” your ex-girlfriendâ€™s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another 2-for-1 sale on hand sanitizer â€” chances are you donâ€™t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. And thatâ€™s your real problem. Not the hand sanitizer.\r\nWay too many fucks given.\r\nWay too many fucks given.\r\n\r\nIn life, our fucks must be spent on something. There really is no such thing as not giving a fuck. The question is simply how we each choose to allot our fucks. You only get a limited number of fucks to give over your lifetime, so you must spend them with care. As my father used to say, â€œFucks donâ€™t grow on trees, Mark.â€ OK, he never actually said that. But fuck it, pretend like he did. The point is that fucks have to be earned and then invested wisely. Fucks are cultivated like a beautiful fucking garden, where if you fuck shit up and the fucks get fucked, then youâ€™ve fucking fucked your fucks all the fuck up.\r\nSubtlety #3: We All Have A Limited Number Of Fucks To Give; Pay Attention To Where And Who You Give Them To\r\n\r\nWhen weâ€™re young, we have tons of energy. Everything is new and exciting. And everything seems to matter so much. Therefore, we give tons of fucks. We give a fuck about everything and everyone â€” about what people are saying about us, about whether that cute boy/girl called us back or not, about whether our socks match or not or what color our birthday balloon is.\r\n\r\nAs we get older, we gain experience and begin to notice that most of these things have little lasting impact on our lives. Those peopleâ€™s opinions we cared about so much before have long been removed from our lives. Weâ€™ve found the love we need and so those embarrassing romantic rejections cease to mean much anymore. We realize how little people pay attention to the superficial details about us and we focus on doing things more for ourselves rather than for others.\r\nBunk Moreland, not giving a fuck since 2002.\r\nBunk Moreland, not giving a fuck since 2002.\r\n\r\nEssentially, we become more selective about the fucks weâ€™re willing to give. This is something called â€˜maturity.â€™ Itâ€™s nice, you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about whatâ€™s truly fuckworthy. As Bunk Moreland said in The Wire (which, fuck you, I still downloaded it) to his partner Detective McNulty: â€œThatâ€™s what you get for giving a fuck when it wasnâ€™t your turn to give a fuck.â€\r\n\r\nThen, as we grow older and enter middle age, something else begins to change. Our energy levels drop. Our identities solidify. We know who we are and we no longer have a desire to change what now seems inevitable in our lives.\r\n\r\nAnd in a strange way, this is liberating. We no longer need to give a fuck about everything. Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that weâ€™re never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Anistonâ€™s tits. And thatâ€™s OK. Life fucking goes on. We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks only for the most truly fuckworthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing. And to our astonishment, this is enough. This simplification actually makes us really fucking happy.\r\n\r\nFrankly, my dear, I don\'t give a fuck\r\n\r\nThen somehow, one day, much later, we wake up and weâ€™re old. And along with our gum lines and our sex drive, our ability to give a fuck has receded to the point of non-existence. In the twilight of our days, we carry out a paradoxical existence where we no longer have the energy to give a fuck about the big things in life, and instead we must dedicate the few fucks we have left to the simple and mundane yet increasingly difficult aspects of our lives: where to eat lunch, doctors appointments for our creaky joints, 30-cent discounts at the supermarket, and driving without drifting to sleep and killing a parking lot full of orphans. You know, practical concerns.\r\n\r\nThen one day, on our deathbed, (hopefully) surrounded by the people we gave the majority of our fucks to throughout our life, and those few who still give a fuck about us, with a silent gasp we will gently let our last fuck go. Through the tears and the gently fading beeps of the heart monitor and the dimming fluorescence encapsulating us in its divine hospital halo, we drift into some unknowable and unfuckable void.\r\n\r\nNamaste, Fuckface.\r\n\r\nThis article is an excerpt from my book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck: A Counterintuitive Guide to Living A Good Life\r\n\r\nNote: Iâ€™ve recorded a 10-minute audio commentary to this article where I talk about my writing process, what I was going through when I wrote this article and how insanely often it was shared and read.

(8, 5, 'The Most Important Question of Your Life', '                    Everybody wants what feels good. Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the Red Sea when you walk into the room.\r\n\r\nEveryone would like that â€” itâ€™s easy to like that.\r\n\r\nIf I ask you, â€œWhat do you want out of life?â€ and you say something like, â€œI want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like,â€ itâ€™s so ubiquitous that it doesnâ€™t even mean anything.\r\n\r\nA more interesting question, a question that perhaps youâ€™ve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for? Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.\r\n\r\nEverybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independence â€” but not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blasÃ© confines of an infinite cubicle hell. People want to be rich without the risk, without the sacrifice, without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth.\r\n\r\nEverybody wants to have great sex and an awesome relationship â€” but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there. And so they settle. They settle and wonder â€œWhat if?â€ for years and years until the question morphs from â€œWhat if?â€ into â€œWas that it?â€ And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, â€œWhat was that for?â€ if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for?\r\n\r\nBecause happiness requires struggle. The positive is the side effect of handling the negative. You can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life.\r\n\r\nAt the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar. Positive experience is easy to handle. Itâ€™s negative experience that we all, by definition, struggle with. Therefore, what we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings weâ€™re willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings.\r\n\r\nPeople want an amazing physique. But you donâ€™t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions.\r\n\r\nPeople want to start their own business or become financially independent. But you donâ€™t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, and working insane hours on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not.\r\n\r\nPeople want a partner, a spouse. But you donâ€™t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. Itâ€™s part of the game of love. You canâ€™t win if you donâ€™t play.\r\n\r\nWhat determines your success isnâ€™t â€œWhat do you want to enjoy?â€ The question is, â€œWhat pain do you want to sustain?â€ The quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but the quality of your negative experiences. And to get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life.\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s a lot of crappy advice out there that says, â€œYouâ€™ve just got to want it enough!â€\r\n\r\nEverybody wants something. And everybody wants something enough. They just arenâ€™t aware of what it is they want, or rather, what they want â€œenough.â€\r\n\r\nBecause if you want the benefits of something in life, you have to also want the costs. If you want the beach body, you have to want the sweat, the soreness, the early mornings, and the hunger pangs. If you want the yacht, you have to also want the late nights, the risky business moves, and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise. Maybe what you want isnâ€™t what you want, you just enjoy wanting. Maybe you donâ€™t actually want it at all.\r\n\r\nSometimes I ask people, â€œHow do you choose to suffer?â€ These people tilt their heads and look at me like I have twelve noses. But I ask because that tells me far more about you than your desires and fantasies. Because you have to choose something. You canâ€™t have a pain-free life. It canâ€™t all be roses and unicorns. And ultimately thatâ€™s the hard question that matters. Pleasure is an easy question. And pretty much all of us have similar answers. The more interesting question is the pain. What is the pain that you want to sustain?\r\n\r\nThat answer will actually get you somewhere. Itâ€™s the question that can change your life. Itâ€™s what makes me me and you you. Itâ€™s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together.\r\n\r\nFor most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician â€” a rock star, in particular. Any badass guitar song I heard, I would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling. This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. The fantasizing continued up through college, even after I dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously. But even then it was never a question of if Iâ€™d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. I was biding my time before I could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work. First, I needed to finish school. Then, I needed to make money. Then, I needed to find the time. Thenâ€¦ and then nothing.\r\n\r\nDespite fantasizing about this for over half of my life, the reality never came. And it took me a long time and a lot of negative experiences to finally figure out why: I didnâ€™t actually want it.\r\n\r\nI was in love with the result â€” the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what Iâ€™m playing â€” but I wasnâ€™t in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly. Hell, I didnâ€™t even try hard enough to fail at it. I hardly tried at all.\r\n\r\nThe daily drudgery of practicing, the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing, the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit. The broken strings, the blown tube amp, hauling 40 pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car. Itâ€™s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didnâ€™t like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the top.\r\n\r\nOur culture would tell me that Iâ€™ve somehow failed myself, that Iâ€™m a quitter or a loser. Self-help would say that I either wasnâ€™t courageous enough, determined enough or I didnâ€™t believe in myself enough. The entrepreneurial/start-up crowd would tell me that I chickened out on my dream and gave in to my conventional social conditioning. Iâ€™d be told to do affirmations or join a mastermind group or manifest or something.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is far less interesting than that: I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didnâ€™t. End of story.\r\n\r\nI wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love not with the fight but only the victory. And life doesnâ€™t work that way.\r\n\r\nWho you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who move up it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.\r\n\r\nThis is not a call for willpower or â€œgrit.â€ This is not another admonishment of â€œno pain, no gain.â€\r\n\r\nThis is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. So choose your struggles wisely, my friend.\r\n\r\nThis article is an excerpt from my book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck: A Counterintuitive Guide to Living A Good Life\r\n\r\nNote: Iâ€™ve recorded an 8-minute audio commentary where I go into how this article has been the most impactful and important article Iâ€™ve written.

(27, 6, 'How to Find Your Passion for Anything', '            Whether itâ€™s a new technology, a foreign language, or an advanced skill, staying competitive often means learning new things. Nearly two-thirds of U.S. workers have taken a course or sought additional training to advance their careers, according to a March 2016 study by Pew Research Center. They report that results have included an expanded professional network, new job or different career path.\r\n\r\nBeing a quick learner can give you an even greater edge. Science proves there are six ways you can learn and retain something faster.\r\n1. Teach Someone Else (Or Just Pretend To)\r\n\r\nIf you imagine that youâ€™ll need to teach someone else the material or task you are trying to grasp, you can speed up your learning and remember more, according to a study done at Washington University in St. Louis. The expectation changes your mind-set so that you engage in more effective approaches to learning than those who simply learn to pass a test, according to John Nestojko, a postdoctoral researcher in psychology and coauthor of the study.\r\n\"Sleeping between two learning sessions greatly improves retention.\"\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen teachers prepare to teach, they tend to seek out key points and organize information into a coherent structure,â€ Nestojko writes. â€œOur results suggest that students also turn to these types of effective learning strategies when they expect to teach.â€\r\n2. Learn In Short Bursts of Time\r\n\r\nExperts at the Louisiana State Universityâ€™s Center for Academic Success suggest dedicating 30-50 minutes to learning new material. â€œAnything less than 30 is just not enough, but anything more than 50 is too much information for your brain to take in at one time,â€ writes learning strategies graduate assistant Ellen Dunn. Once youâ€™re done, take a five to 10 minute break before you start another session.\r\n\r\nBrief, frequent learning sessions are much better than longer, infrequent ones, agrees Neil Starr, a course mentor at Western Governors University, an online nonprofit university where the average student earns a bachelorâ€™s degree in two and a half years.\r\n\"Changing the way you practice a new motor skill can help you master it faster.\"\r\n\r\nHe recommends preparing for micro learning sessions. â€œMake note cards by hand for the more difficult concepts you are trying to master,â€ he says. â€œYou never know when youâ€™ll have some in-between time to take advantage of.â€\r\n3. Take Notes By Hand\r\n\r\nWhile itâ€™s faster to take notes on a laptop, using a pen and paper will help you learn and comprehend better. Researchers at Princeton University and UCLA found that when students took notes by hand, they listened more actively and were able to identify important concepts. Taking notes on a laptop, however, leads to mindless transcription, as well as an opportunity for distraction, such as email.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand,â€ writes coauthor and Princeton University psychology professor Pam Mueller. â€œWe show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takersâ€™ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.â€\r\n4. Use The Power of Mental Spacing\r\n\r\nWhile it sounds counterintuitive, you can learn faster when you practice distributed learning, or â€œspacing.â€ In an interview with The New York Times, Benedict Carey, author of How We Learn: The Surprising Truth About When, Where, and Why It Happens, says learning is like watering a lawn. â€œYou can water a lawn once a week for 90 minutes or three times a week for 30 minutes,â€ he said. â€œSpacing out the watering during the week will keep the lawn greener over time.â€\r\n\r\nTo retain material, Carey said itâ€™s best to review the information one to two days after first studying it. â€œOne theory is that the brain actually pays less attention during short learning intervals,â€ he said in the interview. â€œSo repeating the information over a longer intervalâ€“say a few days or a week later, rather than in rapid successionâ€“sends a stronger signal to the brain that it needs to retain the information.â€\r\n5. Take A Study Nap\r\n\r\nDowntime is important when it comes to retaining what you learn, and getting sleep in between study sessions can boost your recall up to six months later, according to new research published in Psychological Science.\r\n\r\nIn an experiment held in France, participants were taught the Swahili translation for 16 French words in two sessions. Participants in the â€œwakeâ€ group completed the first learning session in the morning and the second session in the evening of the same day, while participants in the â€œsleepâ€ group completed the first session in the evening, slept, and then completed the second session the following morning. Participants who had slept between sessions recalled about 10 of the 16 words, on average, while those who hadnâ€™t slept recalled only about 7.5 words.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur results suggest that interweaving sleep between practice sessions leads to a twofold advantage, reducing the time spent relearning and ensuring a much better long-term retention than practice alone,â€ writes psychological scientist Stephanie Mazza of the University of Lyon. â€œPrevious research suggested that sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy, but now we show that sleeping between two learning sessions greatly improves such a strategy.â€\r\n6. Change It Up\r\n\r\nWhen learning a new motor skill, changing the way you practice it can help you master it faster, according to a new study at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In an experiment, participants were asked to learn a computer-based task. Those who used a modified learning technique during their second session performed better than those who repeated the same method.\r\n\r\nThe findings suggest that reconsolidationâ€“a process in which existing memories are recalled and modified with new knowledgeâ€“plays a key role in strengthening motor skills, writes Pablo A. Celnik, senior study author and professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat we found is if you practice a slightly modified version of a task you want to master,â€ he writes, â€œyou actually learn more and faster than if you just keep practicing the exact same thing multiple times in a row.â€        ', 'Stephanie Vozza', 'Learning Tips', '2018-04-05 23:55:50'),

Read the error message carefully. It says \"output started at ...\" followed by a file name and a line number. That is the file (and line) that you need to edit. Ignore the second file name - that is only a file that included the file that has the whitespace. The first file is the one you have to edit, not the second one.\r\n\r\nSince the editor you\'ve been using caused this problem in the first place, you should use another editor to fix the problem and remove the whitespace.
